## TITLE : Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of Employee Data

#### Description: 
This project involves cleaning a raw dataset of employee information and performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) to prepare the data for further analysis or machine learning tasks. The dataset includes employee details such as Name, Domain, Age, Location, Salary, and Experience. The focus is on cleaning the data by addressing issues like special characters, missing values, and incorrect data formats. After cleaning, the project proceeds with basic statistical analysis and visualization to understand the relationships between different features, especially between experience and salary.

### Responsibilities:
#### 1.Data Cleaning:
* Removing unwanted characters (e.g., special characters) from columns such as Name, Domain, Age, Location, and Salary.
* Handling missing values in columns such as Age, Location, and Experience using techniques like filling with the mean or mode.
* Converting columns to appropriate data types (e.g., Age, Salary, Experience to integers).
#### 2.Data Transformation:
* Standardizing formats and removing noise in the data to make it suitable for analysis.
* Applying correct data types to columns to ensure compatibility with machine learning models.
#### 3.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
* Visualizing the distribution of variables such as Salary and Experience.
* Identifying potential correlations or patterns between features (e.g., Experience vs. Salary).
* Summarizing the dataset to uncover insights and trends.
#### 4.Data Export:
Saving the cleaned data in a CSV file for further analysis or use in machine learning models.
